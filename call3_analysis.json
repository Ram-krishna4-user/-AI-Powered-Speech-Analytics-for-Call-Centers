    "issue_type": "Balance deduction rate",
    "summary": "The customer, Mr. Kunal, called to complain that his mobile balance is depleting too quickly, stating 'balance is very fast speed going now'. He repeatedly expressed a desire for his balance to 'go slowly', which the agent, Ambika, struggled to understand due to a significant communication barrier. The agent attempted to clarify if the customer wanted his balance to deduct slowly or if he wanted to deactivate a 'dialect' service, but the customer consistently reverted to the balance issue. Despite multiple attempts from both sides, the problem was not clearly understood, and the call ended with the customer expressing frustration that the problem was not solved."
